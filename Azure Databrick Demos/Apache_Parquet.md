# üì¶ Apache Parquet File Format ‚Äì Beginner to Advanced Guide

## üîç What is a Parquet File?

**Apache Parquet** is an open-source, columnar file format optimized for analytical workloads on large-scale data platforms like Spark, Hive, Presto, and Databricks.

- It stores data **by column** instead of by row.
- Designed for performance and storage efficiency.
- Used in big data pipelines and cloud-based analytics.

## ‚úÖ Why Choose Parquet?

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Columnar Storage** | Only needed columns are read ‚Üí faster performance. |
| **Efficient Compression** | Repeated values in columns are highly compressible. |
| **Schema Support** | Maintains data types and supports schema evolution. |
| **Optimized for Distributed Systems** | Splittable and parallelizable by nature. |
| **Integration** | Supported in Spark, Hive, AWS Athena, Azure Synapse, and more. |

## üîß Where and When to Use Parquet

| Use Case | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| **Data Lakes** | Ideal for storage in ADLS, S3, GCS |
| **ETL Pipelines** | Efficient format for Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold |
| **Big Data Archival** | Stores large datasets efficiently |
| **Analytics** | Supports predicate pushdown, vectorized reads |
| **Streaming & Batch Workloads** | Well-suited for both cases |

## üÜö Parquet vs Other Formats

| Format | Type | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|------|
| CSV | Row-based | Easy to read, universal | No types, no compression, slow |
| JSON | Semi-structured | Nested data, human-readable | Large size, slow parsing |
| Parquet | Columnar, binary | Compressed, fast, typed | Not human-readable |
| Avro | Row-based | Good for streaming | Not column-optimized |
| ORC | Columnar | Similar to Parquet, Hive-optimized | Less support outside Hive |

## üí° Performance Benefits

### 1. **Columnar Format**
Only reads selected columns ‚Üí faster I/O.

### 2. **Predicate Pushdown**
Applies filters (`WHERE`, `>`, `=`, etc.) during file read.

### 3. **Vectorized Execution**
Reads multiple rows in a single CPU instruction.

### 4. **Compression**
Common column values lead to excellent compression with Snappy or Gzip.

## üõ† PySpark Example

```python
# Writing to Parquet
df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("output/sales.parquet")

# Reading from Parquet
df_parquet = spark.read.parquet("output/sales.parquet")
df_parquet.show()
```

## üìà When Not to Use Parquet?

- When working with small files or debugging (use CSV/JSON)
- If your application does not support binary formats
- For quick, manual inspection of data

---

## üåê Usage in Cloud Platforms

| Platform | Integration |
|----------|-------------|
| **Azure** | Data Lake, Synapse, Databricks, ADF |
| **AWS** | S3 + Athena, Redshift Spectrum, EMR |
| **Google Cloud** | GCS + BigQuery External, Dataproc |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Parquet is best for **analytics**, **storage efficiency**, and **big data performance**.
- Use Parquet when reading large data in Spark, querying in Athena, or transforming with Databricks.
- It‚Äôs the backbone of **modern data lake architectures** like **Delta Lake**, **Iceberg**, and **Hudi**.
