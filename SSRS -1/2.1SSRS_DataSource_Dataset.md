# SSRS Data Source, Dataset, and Shared Data Source â€“ Detailed Notes

## 1. Data Source in SSRS
A **Data Source** is a connection configuration that tells SSRS **where to get the data from**.
It contains:
- Type of source (SQL Server, Oracle, Excel, OData, Azure SQL, etc.)
- Connection string (server name, database name, authentication details)
- Credentials (Windows auth, SQL auth, etc.)

**Example:**
```
Data Source=SQLSRV01;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks2014;Integrated Security=True
```

## 2. Dataset in SSRS
A **Dataset** is the actual **data retrieval query** that SSRS uses to bring records into your report.
- Based on a Data Source.
- Contains a query (T-SQL, MDX, DAX, etc.) or calls a stored procedure.
- Defines fields that can be placed in your report.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice 
FROM Production.Product
WHERE ListPrice > @MinPrice
```

## 3. Shared Data Source vs. Embedded (Unshared) Data Source
### Shared Data Source
- Created once and stored centrally on the SSRS server (or in the Visual Studio project under "Shared Data Sources").
- Can be reused by multiple reports.
- Changes in one place apply to all reports that use it.
- Stored as a `.rds` file in your SSRS project.

### Embedded (Unshared) Data Source
- Defined inside a single report.
- Cannot be reused by other reports.
- Stored inside the `.rdl` file.

## 4. Why Use a Shared Data Source?
- Centralized management
- Consistency across reports
- Security control
- Reduced maintenance

**Real-World Scenario:**
Your company migrates the Sales Database to a new server.
- With Embedded Data Sources, you must open and update each report.
- With a Shared Data Source, you update once and all reports work.

## 5. By Default: Shared or Unshared?
- When creating a new report, a Data Source defined inside it is Embedded (Unshared) by default.
- To make it shared, create it under "Shared Data Sources" and link it.
